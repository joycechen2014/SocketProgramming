Q1: Which of the following statements about Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) are true? Mark all that apply.
A. Noise power spectral density has a Gaussian Distribution, i.e., noise is highest at a mean frequency.(correct)
B. Noise power spectral density is flat, i.e., it does not depend on frequency.
C. Noise is added on to the signal of interest.
